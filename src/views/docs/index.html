# Quick Start

## 0. Install Node.js

Fabricator is built on Node.js, a platform for building fast, scalable network applications. There are pre-built [installers for each platform](http://nodejs.org/download/). You can also install with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) via `brew install node`

## 1. Download Fabricator Instance

Each toolkit starts with a new, unique instance of Fabricator. You can grab the latest with this one-liner:

```shell
$ curl -L https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx --strip 1
```

Alternatively, you can use the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/fbrctr/generator-fabricator) to scaffold a new project for you. 
If you haven't installed Yeoman yet, make sure to install it:

```shell
$ npm install -g yo
```

Then install and run the generator using:

```shell
$ npm install -g generator-fabricator
$ yo fabricator
```

## 2. Start Building

Once your instance is setup, you're ready to start building. Start the development environment by running:

```shell
$ npm start
```
